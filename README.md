## How to install

```bash
cd MagicMirror/modules
```
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PierreGode/MMM-next-episode
```
```bash
cd MMM-next-episode
```
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

In `~/MagicMirror/config/config.js`:

```js
{
  module: "MMM-next-episode",
  position: "bottom_right",
  header: "Next-Episode",
  config: {
    id: '',
    hash_key: '',
    username: '',
    password '',
    displaySeasonAndEpisode: false,
    displayShowingOn: false,
    displayEpisodeName: false,
    maxdays: 7,
    ShowThumbnail: true,
    ThumbnailSize: 'small',
    updateInterval: 180
  }
},
```

### How to get your id and hash_key

Set  username: '', and password '', in the config.js

When starting the module the first time without id and hash_key in the config, a QR code will be displayed on the mirror. Like this example:

![example QR code](img/screenshotqrcode.png)

Scan the QR code from your mirror and a page will show your id and hash They might come together as a one line but the first 9 digits are the id and the rest is the hash.

**Note: You only need to set username and password for Next-Episode in the config.js to get the id and hash, after you added the ID and Hash to the config.js the username and password can be removed from config.js**.

**Note:** Using special characters such as '+', '"', '^', '%', '$', '#', in your password can cause the link to break. You may consider temporarily changing your password for this purpose.

After adding values `id` and `hash_key` in the config above, restart the MagicMirror.
